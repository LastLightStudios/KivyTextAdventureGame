# KivyTextAdventureGame

## Overview
This game is a collaboration between a friend and I. This game will be a text based RPG with
the context menu in the bottom to act as a controller for the Player.

This is the latest progress video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89AgGVK0FEY

In the video you can see:
Context menu changes based on the available actions.
Health bar on the GUI works.
Top right shows a list of the characters available to interact with in the room.
The player can talk to the other characters.

I will do my best to keep this readme updated with the most recent progress videos.


TODO:
Combat and everything that entails
Enemy health tracking
Turn order

Eventually, damage types and so on are planned.
